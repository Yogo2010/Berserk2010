        <h3>
          **Berserk** (ベルセルク, Beruseruku) is a fantasy manga written by
          Kentaro Miura. The first volume was published in 1989, and the manga
          continues to be released to this day, maintaining its popularity.
          Additionally, several video games, a 25-episode anime adaptation, and
          three full-length animated films have been created based on the manga.
          As of now, 349 chapters of the manga have been published in Japan in
          the *Young Animal* magazine. The separate volume edition currently
          consists of 37 tankōbon volumes. In November 2009, the *Comics-Art*
          company announced that it had acquired the license for the Russian
          edition of the *Berserk* manga series, and on June 24, 2010, the first
          volume was released. One of the most popular adult manga series, with
          over 29 million copies sold, *Berserk* tells the life story of a
          mercenary named Guts. The events unfold in a world reminiscent of
          medieval Europe. The core of the plot revolves around mystical events
          surrounding Guts and his relationship with Griffith, the leader of the
          mercenary group known as the *Band of the Hawk* (鷹の団, *Taka no
          Dan*). Both the manga and the anime are characterized by extreme
          brutality, making the series a classic example of *dark fantasy*.
